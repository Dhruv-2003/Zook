# Contracts

- ChannelModule : the Safe Module to handle the tx on top of Safe Smart Contract , this will have an initialiser to create the channel between 2 parties in a safe Contract , it also have verify function to check the signatures or ZK proof directly for implementing the withdraw throught the safe contracts

- CircuitVerify : AutoGenerated via Circom circuit by the compiler , used to verify a ZK proof just created on chain along with public inputs

- ERC1155 Contract works together with modules - This NFT contracts defines the recepients of a channel , Each Token ID is for every new person creating the channel , and sends the NFT to recepient while doing so , can be sent to n recepients .

# Circuits

- Create our own circuit which generates the Zk Proof on the basis of the Public inputs
  // verify the Contract Address is the payment channel one
  // the total amount now is the expected one
  // The new total is not exceeding the ether Escrowed
  // verify if the sig is from the sender is should be from

- A Direct Zk proof with Sismo , to verify the recepient of a channel , It just takes up the user address, and checks if they owns that specific tokenID from the ERc1155 , later ZK - Proof can be sent on-chain to be verified , and the recepient will be allowed to withdraw.
